# Federated Learning for Next-Word Prediction

By AI Sweden Young Talents: Västerås.


# Navigating this codebase

You can find the training notebook for our final model in [./train](https://github.com/aidotse/next-word-fedn/tree/main/train)

The client code for federated learning is in the [./client](https://github.com/aidotse/next-word-fedn/tree/main/client)

You can find old files and old models in the [./old](https://github.com/aidotse/next-word-fedn/tree/main/old)

We also kept the data in git and is located in [./data](https://github.com/aidotse/next-word-fedn/tree/main/data)

## Intro

This project we took in collaboration with Scalout. 

We were assigned to use their platform for federated learning and select a relevant industry + usecase to make the project in.

The industry we choosed was Mobile devices and the use case was next-word prediction.

A measurable goal we chose was to make it learn a new word.

## Outcome

The final product is a foundation model, web-UI, and a fedn project that works with scaleout.

When presenting this project we managed to train it on hard-coded data from Scaleout's documentation.

After the model had trained in a client and aggregated through Scaleout's platform, we could see a notable difference in how it could predict words related to federated learning.
